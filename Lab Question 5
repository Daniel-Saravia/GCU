#This is my own work

#user input
text = input("Enter a number: ")
#try for inputs that are not numbers
try:
    number = int(text)
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")
else:
    #number.bit_count() is a new addition to python 3.10 which counts the 1's
    #bin(number) gets the binary number for the input
    #replace("0b", "") gets rid of the 0b in the front which is short for base 2 aka binary
    print("({},'{}')".format(number.bit_count(), bin(number).replace("0b", "")))
